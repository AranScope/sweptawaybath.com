After ten minutes, the fire is going well inside the stove.

Turn the air supply down a little but aim to maintain a lively fire.

Re fueling After one or two hours you should have a glowing bed of cinders,open the door spread out the cinders evenly,now place 3 or 4 logs on the bed of cinders.Left to right if you want a hotter fire.Front to back â€“  if you prefer the fire to burn a little slower.Close the door and open all vents now let the fire roar for 10 minutes or so do not leave it un attended until the initial gases have burnt off.For maximum efficiency close the bottom vent perhaps not quite all the way, adjust the top vent until you see the flames dancing above the fuel.You will know you have hit the sweet spot when the flames are blue and rolling.
