> **Caution:** Replacing fire bricks can be tricky. If you believe that your fire bricks need replacing, source new bricks, book a sweep and we'll happily fit them for free!



The firebricks in a stove reflect heat back into the fire which allows for a hotter, cleaner burn but these are wear items and will need replacement from time to time.\
\
**Example 1:** If a brick is well supported on three sides, then it can remain in place.

**Example 2:** As a general rule, a single hairline crack is not a problem.

**Example 3:** If it looks like it could fall into the fire, replace it.

**Example 4:** If you can see the stove wall behind, replace it.
