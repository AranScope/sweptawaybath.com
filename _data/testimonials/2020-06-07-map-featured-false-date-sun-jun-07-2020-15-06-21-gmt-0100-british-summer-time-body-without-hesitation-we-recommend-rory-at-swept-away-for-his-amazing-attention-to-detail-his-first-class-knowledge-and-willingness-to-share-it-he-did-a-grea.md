Without hesitation we recommend Rory at Swept Away for his **amazing attention to detail**, his **first class knowledge** and **willingness to share it**.

He did a great job on our five fireplaces and left everything as clean as he found it. A really excellent experience with a very characterful man. We would thoroughly recommend him to anyone in Bath or surrounding area, and will definitely use him again.
