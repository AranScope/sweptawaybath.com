What a great service. Prompt, skilled and friendly. We now know we have a mesh over our pot which had not been spotted by the other sweeps we have had and this could have been dangerous. No mess at all and we feel safe now and ready for our winter fires. See you next year! Many Thanks the Holden Family.
